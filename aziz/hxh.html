      The Zoldyck Family owns and lives at the Kukuroo Mountain, a dormant
      volcano in the Dentora region of the Republic of Padokea, which stands at
      3,722 meters (approx. 12,211 feet). Their estate is surrounded by huge
      stone walls guarded by a giant hunting beast named Mike and attendants
      highly skilled in martial arts. Only few people unrelated to the family
      have any information about what is within the estate. The appearances of
      the members of the family are unknown to the public at large, and a single
      photo of any of the members can be sold for millions as the identity of a
      single member is only known by a few individuals.[1] Their family name
      alone can strike fear and terror in the underworld even more than the
      presence of the whole Phantom Troupe.[2] Children in the family are
      trained from birth in the art of assassination, although each member of
      the family has the privilege to choose the specialty of their abilities
      and liking as they grow up: the oldest child, Illumi, is a master of
      disguise; whereas the next oldest, Milluki, is a computer wizard and an
      expert hacker. The third son, Killua, is showing excellent potential to
      become an assassin since early age, his physical skills were so prominent
      that he was sent to the Heavens Arena when he was only six-year-old.
      Killua's capability makes him favored to be the successor of the Zoldyck
      family, although he has stated of having no desire to inherit the family's
      business. It is believed that each member of Zoldyck Family begun their
      training from their date of birth. The children are also allowed the use
      of weaponry (pins, bombs, yo-yos, and paper), which are also suited based
      on their Nen abilities. Members are allowed to use a special transmitter
      in their assassination business.[3] They possess a unique set of talents:
      resistance to almost all types of poison, the ability to tolerate high
      amounts of electricity and pain, and immense strength, for example Killua
      was able to open a 16-ton door before receiving any form of Nen
      training.[1] Even at a young age they are already capable fighters and
      assassins. For example, the third son Killua entered Heavens Arena at age
      six and was able to reach the celebrated 200th floor at the age of
      eight.[4] Another example is the youngest son Kalluto who was immediately
      accepted into the most notorious criminal gang, the Phantom Troupe, at the
      age of ten.[5] Without any apparent assassination training, a Zoldyck is
      having a similar power to a normal human, as in the case of Alluka
      Zoldyck. During an intra-mission, when family members have conflicting
      ideals and principles, it is against the rules for them to kill each
      other.[6]
